SYNOPSIS -> <@GIRL> and <@BOY> are great friends. On a Halloween night, they decide to explore <@BUILDING>, which is said to be haunted. When they first enter <@BUILDING>, they encounter a secret passageway to <@WAY1> which is hidden beneath <@BUILDING>, and where they come across the magical, illuminating <@OBJECT>. They also find <@OBJECT2>, but that's not the important issue right now. <@GIRL> is mischievous and plays with <@OBJECT> but before they could stop, they are transported to the unknown world. <@BOY> tries to confess his secretive love for <@GIRL>, but due to the <@GIRL>'s rather adventurous spirit, his words get cut off half-way. There is another secret passageway, marked by <@SOMETHING>, at the end of which there is a door that smells like <@SMELL>. <@GIRL> feels gravitated towards the door, but <@BOY> successfuly convinces her that it would be best if they retrace their steps. However! As they are trying to escape! Appears before them <@GHOST>!! <@GHOST> and the intruders engage in seemingly fruitless conversations, and especially <@BOY>, who is keen on leaving as soon as possible, asks the <@GHOST> for a sense of direction. As they are lost in conversation, <@BOY> realizes <@GIRL> is missing. <@GIRL> in fact gets led by a strange spirit into the door that smells like <@SMELL>! <@BOY> heroically saves <@GIRL>, reminding her how much work she still has left to do and also by destroying the <@OBJECT> which <@GIRL> was holding onto the entire time and which, presumably, caused her hallucinations. Once <@BOY> breaks the <@OBJECT> and hence its spell, they magically return to the entrance of <@BUILDING>, much to their relief and the relief of the audience starting to get sick of this rather cliche plot line. Well, we're not done here. <@BOY> confesses his long-waited love to <@GIRL>, and <@GIRL> either rejects him or receives his love, depending on what the computer chooses. But with the loud sounding of ZAP! <@BOY> awakens in the middle of the library, and realizes it was all but a tasteful dream on a spooky Halloween night.
